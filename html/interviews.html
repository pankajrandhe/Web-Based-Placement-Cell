					<li><strong>A few things to remember</strong></br>
						<ul>
							<li>1. Ensure that the resume has been checked for typos and is structured in a way that makes it easy to read. Highlight your skills and experience relevant to the job.</li></br>

							<li>2. Interviews are used as a tool of judging whether you fit the job as well as the company.</li></br>

							<li>3. Know yourself, inside out. Only when you understand yourself completely can you make the panel understand you.</li></br>

							<li>4. Take time to understand how you want to project yourself during the interview.</li></br>

							<li>5. Everything you say or do makes an impression whether positive or negative. Be it the way you sit, the way you talk or your choice of clothing. Everything matters!</li></br>

							<li>6. Remember, an Interview is like a sales pitch in many ways. So ensure that you present yourself well.</li></br>
						</ul></br>
					<li><strong>Preparing fot the unexpected</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>In some interviews you may be asked to solve a case-study.</li></br>
							<li>You can be asked to give an impromptu presentation or recite a poem.</li></br>
							<li>You may get the silent treatment from the panel or a stress interview may come your way. You can even be asked to leave the room.</li></br>
							<li>Whatever happens, be mentally prepared for any eventuality.</li></br> 
							<li>These situations give the panel an opportunity to assess how you behave in stressful or unexpected situations.</li></br> 
							<li>They just want to get to know the real You. They want to find out if you can handle the job,
								if you are interested in the company and if you are the person they want to have during tough and stressful times.</li></br>
							<li>Stay calm, remain positive and think logically.</li></br>
						</ul>	
					<li><strong>Before the interview</strong>
					<li><strong>Research thr company</strong></br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; Being well informed about the company and industry provides you with a competitive edge. It also conveys a clear message to the interviewer and that is:</br>
						<ul>
							<li>You are career oriented and want to build a career within the industry</li>

							<li>You understand the intricacies of the industry</li>

							<li>You are wholeheartedly interested in working for the company</li></br>
							Read up as much as possible about the company and the industry. </br>You can also talk to people who work in the company or the industry to get a first hand feel about what drives the company and the industry.
						</ul>	
					<li><strong>Appearence</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>First impressions are made within the first few minutes and are very important for a successful interview.</li>
							<li>Most employers prefer candidates wearing formal attire (Indian or western).</li> 
							<li>Dress soberly and neatly. It is better to be conservative in the choice of clothes. Avoid flashy clothes or strong perfumes. Jewellery should be at a bare minimum.
							<li>Have your clothes ironed and keep it ready in advance, so that you do not waste time in selecting a dress on the day of the interview. This also avoids last minute problems like a stained shirt, wrinkled tie, missing buttons or unpolished shoes.</li>
