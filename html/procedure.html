				Compensation Package</br>
				Growth Prospects in the job</br>
				Past record of recruitment at IIT Bombay</br>
				The data provided by the companies through the Job Announcement Form, company brochures including financial statements, etc. are made available to the students to decide the ranking.</br>
				Hoping for your kind co-operation for a bright and blooming placement season.</br>
				Student Placement Representatives,</br>
				Placement Cell,</br>
